# Q-Learning for World Grid Navigation

## Project Overview

* Implement Q - learning algorithm
* Make the robot reach the goal by maximizing the total reward of the trip
* Make Q-function converge to the optimal values
* MATLAB is used

## Finding optimal route

* Before the program is started, Q – function is initialized as zero and k value is updated after each trial and Q value is updated after each run.
* In each trial, to balance the exploration – exploitation, greedy exploration policy is applied to find the action for next step.
* To get the optimal value of Q, the probability must be higher than exploration probability which can also reduce exploration
